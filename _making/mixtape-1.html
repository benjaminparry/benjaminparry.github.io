## Artists, tracks and albums

### Love Will Tear Us Apart – Kiyoaki Iwamoto

There’s some songs that don’t need messing with. Joy Division’s classic Love Will Tear Apart is definitely one of them. Kiyoaki Iwamoto’s interpretation is an exception. The arrangement is pretty similar but there’s a few unique changes that really add to to the original.

[Check out the full album SOUGI​+ on Bandcamp](https://emrecords.bandcamp.com/album/sougi?from=search&search_item_id=2461514823&search_item_type=a&search_match_part=%3F&search_page_id=2633268307&search_page_no=1&search_rank=1&search_sig=b881408e9cb17ab5e5b759f0232bf005).

[Osaka based EM Records](https://emrecords.net/) is a great source of discovering past and present Japanese music and musicians.

### Tanihara – Akko Gorilla

I was introduced to Akko Gorilla through the Japan 2.0 podcast. The [Regional Food in Japan episode](https://japan2point0.wordpress.com/2021/06/29/regional-food-in-japan/) featured their track [TOKYO BANANA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLnMkRViftE) from the same album as Tanihara. They have a broad range of music styles across songs and albums but the album TOKYO BANANA has some creative and unique HIP HOP.

[Buy TOKYO BANANA on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/release/10812588-%E3%81%82%E3%81%A3%E3%81%93%E3%82%B4%E3%83%AA%E3%83%A9-Tokyo-Banana)

### Because That‘s Right!? – Chudoku

One of the standout tracks featured on Punk, New wave, Hardcore compilation [乱痴気オムニバス 2](https://www.discogs.com/release/3094947-Various-%E4%B9%B1%E7%97%B4%E6%B0%97%E3%82%AA%E3%83%A0%E3%83%8B%E3%83%90%E3%82%B9-2).

### WOO! GO! – ATARASHII GAKKO!

I was introduced to ATARASHII GAKKO! through VFX mythbuster YouTuber Captain Disillusion. They appeared on his episode [Music Video VFX Magic With ATARASHII GAKKO!](https://youtu.be/0Cz8CjLq0fQ) and I was instantly obsessed. A head-strong group of young women packed with musical and [dance skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfRgic0Ye1k). This track was taken from the music video of their [Nike Juku collaboration](https://www.wktokyo.com/en/work/nike-juku). This hard-hitting track is pretty unique amongst their music style.

[Check out on ATARASHII GAKKO! Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/artist/8865106-%E6%96%B0%E3%81%97%E3%81%84%E5%AD%A6%E6%A0%A1%E3%81%AE%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA)

### Katinaka – Masami Shinoda

I found out about Masami Shinoda’s Compostela through an article online I can no longer found. It’s a tour de force from opener to closer and well worth a listen.

[Buy Compostela on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/release/10387994-%E7%AF%A0%E7%94%B0%E6%98%8C%E5%B7%B3-Compostela-Compostela)

### Rragg – Melt-Banana

Not for the feint-hearted or sensitive ears, Melt-Banana and their 57 second song Rragg taken from their album Speak Squeak Creak. Known for their ridiculously short, hard and noise-flooded tracks. They tour regularly and their live performances are out of this world.

[Buy Speak Squeak Creak on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/release/992480-Melt-Banana-Speak-Squeak-Creak)

### Sumo Jungle – Soichi Terada

Jungle from Japan… what’s not to like? I don’t know a lot about Soichi Terada but they appear to release a lot of music under different aliases.

[Check out Soichi Terada’s back catalogue on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/artist/223013-Soichi-Terada)

### B For Boredoms – Boredoms

Okay, things are going to get weird. Weird and noisy. Taken from their album Chocolate Synthesizer this is probably the most accessible track. Another band who’s output differs massively over time and albums. Known for playing live with at least 2 drum kits and [up to 77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77_Boa_Drum). Certainly not for everyone.

### Smoke – Cornelius

Cornelius was probably one of the first Japanese musicians I started listening to. His album Point is an interlaced soundscape of genres and arrangements. This album is best listened in it’s entirety, start to finish.

[Buy Point on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/master/95964-Cornelius-Point)

### Next – SPIN MASTER A-1 & Shing02

Appearing at the end of [HIDARI, the stop-motion samurai film pilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpefYPLH67A), is the hard-hitter Low High by SPIN MASTER A-1 & Shing02. Next is taken from the album 246911. A creative mix of traditional Japanese music and Hip Hop beats with lyrical ebb and flow. This will make my 2023 album list for sure!

[Buy 246911 on Bandcamp](https://246911.bandcamp.com/album/246911)

### Riding On the Rocket – Shonen Knife

All-time favourites Shonen Knife with one of the best tracks from their album Pretty Little Baka Guy.

[Check out Shonen Knife’s back catalogue on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/artist/130682-Shonen-Knife)

### A – Nisennenmondia

Similar to Shonen Knife, Nisennenmondia is another 3-peice female band. A band I know very little about but know I like and would imagine are one to see like.

[Buy N on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/master/779451-%E3%81%AB%E3%81%9B%E3%82%93%E3%81%AD%E3%82%93%E3%82%82%E3%82%93%E3%81%A0%E3%81%84-N)

### HONKI PONKI – OOIOO

If Boredoms is your weird uncle, OOIIOO is your weird aunt. Another smorgasbord of sounds and arrangements this band is on my ‘Desperately want to see them live!’ list. The closing track on Armonico Hewa, HONKI PONKI, is as silly as it sounds. A bouncy and feel-good track to stating rounding up any 60 mins of music.

[Buy Armonico-Hewa in Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/master/209433-OOIOO-Armonico-Hewa)

### Rock Your Baby – Emerson Kitamura

Also discovered on EM Records, Emerson Kitamura’s cover of George McCrae’s funky Rock Your Baby is an absolute gem. The soothing tones and rhythm is a soothing lullaby, slowly rocking you to the best night’s sleep you’ve had in years.

[Buy Emerson Kitamura’s The Countryside is Great EP on Bandcamp](https://emersonkitamura.bandcamp.com/album/12-ep-the-countryside-is-great)
