Last month Jeremy demo’d his [Going Offline](https://abookapart.com/products/going-offline){:target="_blank"} Event Apart talk during a working lunch.

It was a practical tour of enhancing your site to a progressive web app. I was inspired.

Some of my feedback was “I feel like I can leave this room and do that!”. So instead of paying lip service, I decided to follow through.

I followed Jeremy’s post on adding a [service workers](https://adactio.com/journal/13540){:target="_blank"} to a website site. I added his [minimal-serviceworker.js](https://gist.github.com/adactio/3717b7da007a9363ddf21f584aae34af){:target="_blank"} script and hey presto… *it worked!*

Fast forward a few weeks and I’m sitting at Clearleft HQ at the weekly [Brighton Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#Brighton){:target="_blank"} adding an [offline web page](/offline/).

Thanks to Jeremy for helping my with the code, and to everyone for [the great company](https://adactio.com/notes/14976){:target="_blank"}.

Here’s to the next one! 🍻️
