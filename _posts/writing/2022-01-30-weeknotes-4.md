Week 4 is done and dusted. Just a reminder that we’re almost 1/12 of the way through 2022.

## Clearleft HQ and elsewhere

We wrapped up the immerse phase of our current on Friday, playing back everything we’ve learned about academic publishing, and the discovery and access experience for researchers.

Dylan and I have crammed an astonishing amount of work into the last 14 days. We’re both looking forward to taking out foot off the accelerator as we move into out investigate phase for the following 3 weeks.

We welcomed Veronika, our new events manager, to the team this week. More new faces next week, exciting times!

[Andy](https://clearleft.com/about/team/andy-keetch) laid down a challenge in the music Slack channel to create a 5-track playlist that most defines your taste in music. Although it was pretty tough to choose 5 tracks, mostly because Spotify doesn’t list most of my taste in music, I managed to pull together a second-best compilation along with Andy, Rich and Veronica. Listen to it at your own risk… [5ive (the unlistenable)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2U4oo35QWgnR1euliEpKNK).

Track list:

* Bragg – Melt-Banana
* Answers To Your Questions – Loose Fur
* Small People – Wevie Stonder
* amotherfucker – Amen Andrews
* Cloudy – Kevin Drumm

I’ve been in the office this week enjoying the coffee and conversation. Conversation between Rich and I quickly turns to the topic of bikes. Exchanging war stories of riding the South Downs Way, especially the last 3 big climbs into Eastbourne. We got talking about one stretch of path and Rich compared them to [Roubaix cobbles](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/12-pictures-show-just-hard-paris-roubaix-cobbles-219707). He recommended the delightful sounding 1976 film [A Sunday In Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxBTVU9JDrA) documenting the French Paris-Roubaix race and the notorious unforgiving stretch of the course.

We wrapped up the week at our Thursday afternoon meeting (TAM) with a hilarious food-themed Off Menu inspired quiz. I know my colleagues were into their food but this was another level.

## UXup and beyond

It’s been a really fun week of supporting the [UXup](https://twitter.com/UXup_Brighton) team in organising the January meeting. We were treated a fascinating conversation design intro and mini-workshop by [Lorraine Heller](https://twitter.com/LorraineHeller). I had a lot of fun pretending to be a voice assistant helping [Luke](https://twitter.com/hayluke) make plans for dinner. It generated some really interesting discussion.

Here’s a few of the links we shared:

We also discussed some potential topics of talks and workshops at the upcoming UXCampBrighton. [Jo](https://twitter.com/boldscript) raised the shocking and outrageous topic of dubious contracts. I honestly had know idea how shitty they could get. I was genuinely shocked and appalled. [Fiona](https://twitter.com/fmacneill) was keen to explore how research methods could be used to understand the learning process. She shared some really interesting resources including [Liberating Structure 25/10](https://medium.com/@scmstorz/doing-the-liberating-structure-25-10-crowd-sourcing-online-e4aef36678d) and the [Kirkpatrick Training Evaluation Model](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/kirkpatrick.htm).

Fiona also made a great suggesting of a book swap. Keen to get things started I created an Airtable with some of the many books collecting dust. A few other meetup members have added their own books. We’ve already got a great foundation to our library.

## Japan-immersion

I half overheard someone at Clearleft talking about [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai), the concept of finding a sense of purpose. Apparently there might be some Clearleft events news based on this so keep your eyes peeled.

Masami Shinoda’s album [Compostela](https://www.discogs.com/master/1189825-%E7%AF%A0%E7%94%B0%E6%98%8C%E5%B7%B3-Compostela) has been on my playlist a lot this week. It’s a really fun album, especially played loud packing up the office.

[Yanaka](https://youtu.be/-17hRPM1uQY), a sector of Japan, is very close to being added to our itinerary of places to stay. An area of Japan that avoided being bombed it has retained a lot of it’s original buildings. It also is home to [Sawanoya Ryokan](https://youtu.be/q7YYzhZVXYo) a beautiful traditional Japanese inn with a touching story.

Our copy of [Yokai Attack!: The Japanese Monster Survival Guide](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12984182-yokai-attack) arrived this week. A well researched and fascinating guide to Japanese folklore ghosts and goblins. Within hours my son had made a set of Top Trump cards based on the contents.

I finally got around to watching [Audition](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/audition_1999), the Japanese horror classic directed by Takashi Miike. I meant to watch it as part of last week’s slow-themed content as it was listed as a slow-burn horror film. Remembering Miike’s filmography I wasn’t surprised of it’s content.
