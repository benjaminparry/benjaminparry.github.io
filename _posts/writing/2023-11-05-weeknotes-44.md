Wow. What a week!

Most of the last seven days have been dampened by the virus I can’t seen to shift and the epic weather of storm Ciarán.

Halloween celebrations were given a pass for this year but I‘ve been enjoying reports of this year’s [Japanese Jimi ‘Mundane’ Halloween festival costumes](https://www.spoon-tamago.com/jimi-mundane-halloween-2023/) from afar. It’s interesting to see some of the cultural simulates, I feel very seen by ‘passenger who is very likely getting off at the next stop’. It’s not been all parties in the capital though. Shibuya ward released some [inventive graphic design](https://www.spoon-tamago.com/shibuya-anti-halloween-graphics/) to discourage large crowds over safety concerns.

The weather virus combination also meant I couldn’t attend Lewes‘ notorious bonfire celebrations. Thankfully I just need to look outside of my back and front door to see the action. I’m looking forward to getting more involved with the bonfire society next year.

Instead we spent Nov 4th evening playing [Taiko no Tatsujin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin), the Japanese Taiko drum game on the Nintendo Switch. We also re-watched the brilliant [Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Infinite_Two_Minutes), an ultra low budget one-take sci-fi film. Shot during the pandemic, it’s a silly and heart-warming film that is the result of some ambitious constraints.

Working within constraints was one of themes from Friday’s [UX Brighton conference](https://uxbri.org/2023/). Danny curated a really thought provoking lineup and the speakers delivered. I left feeling incredibly inspired and ready to try something new for the week ahead.
