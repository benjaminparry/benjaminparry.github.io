# Pain in the arse

One of the benefits of working at [Clearleft](https://clearleft.com/) is the gift of a 4 week sabbatical after 5 years of service. It‚Äôs a wonderful recognition of your ongoing hard work and commitment to the company and clients.

The timing couldn‚Äôt have been better. The emotional and physical demands of the pandemic. The high demand for research and fast pace of agency life. The transition of key life stages as a family. I am ready for a break.

My 4 week plan was to do as little as possible. Visit family, lots of rest and sleep, reading and reflection, eat well and exercise. I recognised privilege of this rare opportunity of such a long break and wanted to make the most of it.

What could possibly go wrong?

## When life gives you lemons

Just over one week into my sabbatical I have [piriformis syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piriformis_syndrome) which has completely changed the course of my remaining time off. I‚Äôm now resting out of necessity rather than choice.

I‚Äôm obviously very disappointed. But I‚Äôm not devastated.

This isn‚Äôt unfamiliar territory. On paper the projects we work on seem simple. A number of planned activities to achieve desired outcomes over a period of time. Once they start they become complex and painful at times.

Overcoming these challenges comes from a combination of factors:
- Acceptance of the situation
- Honest and open conversation
- Taking action quickly
- Support from an empathic team

Over the next three weeks I‚Äôll be relying on these to help navigate the challenges ahead.

## The sweetest lemonade

I‚Äôm lucky enough to be supported by two of the most wonderful human beings in my life.

I want to say a massive thank you to my wife who is caring for me and pick up the pieces while managing her own huge commitments at this time. I really appreciate the sacrifice you are making for me. And to my son who is supporting me with such empathy and care, I‚Äôm so proud of who you are becoming.

I love you both. üíúÔ∏è
