title: "Introducing Eleventy to an eleven-year-old"

posse: "Spent a couple of hours blowing the mind of an eleven-year-old with Eleventy layout and partial includes. Lots of ear-to-ear grins and excited squeaks.  Kudos to @andy@bell.bz for making his Eleventy From Scratch resource available for free. Granted it’s a few years old but has explained the few concepts I need really well. Looking forward to porting my own site to Eleventy over the Christmas break."
