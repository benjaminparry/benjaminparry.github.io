I’ve not carried a notebook on me for years. I blame Covid-19 and the promise of digital knowledge management tools. Anyway, I recently broke the seal on my cache of (Analog.is)[https://analog.is/] notebooks and took a few on my trip to Japan. I now don’t go anywhere without one and a 0.5 Pilot Drawing Pen. https://optional.is/required/2023/05/03/business-card-notebooks/
